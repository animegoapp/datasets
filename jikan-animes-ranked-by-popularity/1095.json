Although he is always on edge, Naoto no longer seems to mind Nagatoro's presence. Time and again, Naoto demonstrates his hidden, cool demeanor, and Nagatoro displays her possessive tendencies. However, they still can not seem to completely close the distance between them. It is clear to everyone else that the pair have feelings for each other.\n\nFor Nagatoro, there is nothing more entertaining than toying with Naoto. But as the girl shows no plans to stop teasing her senpai, it is only a matter of time before they realize how they truly feel.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san 2nd Attack was released on Blu-ray in four volumes from March 8, 2023 to June 7, 2023.","season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"01:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 01:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":73,"type":"anime","name":"TMS Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/73/TMS_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1344,"type":"anime","name":"King Records","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1344/King_Records"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"OLM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":74,"type":"anime","name":"Romantic Subtext","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/74/Romantic_Subtext"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]}
