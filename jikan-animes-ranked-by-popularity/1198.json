Scorned by his family, he is sent away to live in near isolation. Fortunately, he is not entirely alone, as the manor's staff—his dutiful butler Rob and the flirtatious maid Alice—keep him company and make his life less miserable.\n\nAs the duke's romantic feelings for Alice grow, so does his continued frustration for the limits set by his unfortunate ability. Therefore, he resolves to break the curse cast upon him all those years ago, not only for his sake, but Alice's as well—for he is painfully aware of how difficult it is to avoid the touch of a loved one.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"22:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 22:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":474,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan Music & Digital Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/474/Shogakukan_Music___Digital_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":1113,"type":"anime","name":"NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1113/NBCUniversal_Entertainment_Japan"},{"mal_id":1416,"type":"anime","name":"BS11","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"},{"mal_id":1430,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1430/Shogakukan"},{"mal_id":1492,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri TV Enterprise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"},{"mal_id":1992,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Spirits","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1992/Bandai_Spirits"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":74,"type":"anime","name":"Romantic Subtext","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/74/Romantic_Subtext"}],"demographics":[]}
