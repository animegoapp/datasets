With a smile and a wave, he easily bests his demonic competition, all while loudly proclaiming his hatred for humans. Though he calls for the destruction of humanity, the truth of what lies behind his cheery façade remains a mystery.\n\nDoubtful of Helck's intentions, Red Vamirio—one of the \"Four Heavenly Kings,\" who oversee the realm of the demons together—seeks to uncover what the hero is truly after. With the title of \"Demon King\" at stake, the fate of the demon world rests on her shoulders. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"01:29","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 01:29 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"},{"mal_id":1003,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Television Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"},{"mal_id":1430,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1430/Shogakukan"},{"mal_id":1680,"type":"anime","name":"BS NTV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1680/BS_NTV"},{"mal_id":2098,"type":"anime","name":"Mixer","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2098/Mixer"},{"mal_id":2146,"type":"anime","name":"NetEase","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2146/NetEase"},{"mal_id":2704,"type":"anime","name":"Miki Production","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2704/Miki_Production"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Satelight","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/41/Satelight"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]}
