With two bonafide high school girl protagonists—the short and exceptionally quick to anger Popuko, and the tall and unshakably calm Pipimi—they throw genres against the wall and don't wait to see what sticks. Parody is interlaced with drama, action, crudeness, and the show's overarching goal—to become a real anime.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Poputepipikku is based on bkub Ookawa's 4-koma manga series of the same title. Each episode consists of a 12-minute segment repeated twice. The repeated segment contains a different voiceover by another voice actor with variations on the skits. A remixed rerun titled Pop Team Epic Repeat, which mixes up the voice actors from the original run, began airing from October 9, 2021 and is being simulcast by Crunchyroll. It also features re-recorded versions of the AC-BU segments and Japanese dubs of the Japon Mignon segments. There are also visual differences in the Repeat version.","season":"winter","year":2018,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"01:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 01:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1344,"type":"anime","name":"King Records","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1344/King_Records"},{"mal_id":2272,"type":"anime","name":"AC-Bu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2272/AC-Bu"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":437,"type":"anime","name":"Kamikaze Douga","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/437/Kamikaze_Douga"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":57,"type":"anime","name":"Gag Humor","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/57/Gag_Humor"},{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}],"demographics":[]}
