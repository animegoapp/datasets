As she has already mapped a clear life plan, she has absolute confidence that there will be zero mishaps from then onwards.\n\nDespite her ambitious promise, the country girl ends up running late on the first day when she gets lost on her way to school. Fortunately, she meets a fellow first-year student, Sousuke Shima, who is in the same situation and offers to go with her. They eventually make it to school, but the misfortunes do not end there, as Mitsumi leaves an unfavorable first impression in front of her classmates.\n\nNevertheless, the class soon takes notice of her friendship with Sousuke despite their opposing personalities. Only time will tell whether Mitsumi will be able to forge fruitful relationships with her classmates, and she will certainly not be alone.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Skip to Loafer was released on Blu-ray in two volumes from July 26, 2023, to August 30, 2023.","season":"spring","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"23:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 23:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1412,"type":"anime","name":"Kansai Telecasting","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1412/Kansai_Telecasting"},{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"},{"mal_id":1635,"type":"anime","name":"A-Sketch","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1635/A-Sketch"},{"mal_id":1671,"type":"anime","name":"DMM pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1671/DMM_pictures"},{"mal_id":2139,"type":"anime","name":"DMM Music","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2139/DMM_Music"},{"mal_id":2146,"type":"anime","name":"NetEase","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2146/NetEase"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":132,"type":"anime","name":"P.A.
