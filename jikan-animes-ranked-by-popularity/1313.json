Shocked by his betrayal, Koko's leadership is needed now more than ever to rally her squad and rebuild their foundation of trust before they are torn apart.\n\nJormungand: Perfect Order follows Koko and the rest of her crew as they take on persistent adversaries, overcome internal struggles, and make Koko's vision of world peace a reality—where everything is in perfect order.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2012,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Universal Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/31/Geneon_Universal_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":314,"type":"anime","name":"White Fox","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/314/White_Fox"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":68,"type":"anime","name":"Organized Crime","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/68/Organized_Crime"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}
