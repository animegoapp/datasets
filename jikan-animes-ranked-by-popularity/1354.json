Wary of the royal family's true intentions, Mukouda is able to talk his way out of the situation due to his non-combat skill, \"Online Supermarket,\" which is deemed useless.\n\nHowever, this power proves to be anything but useless. With this ability, Mukouda is able to cheaply purchase food products and utensils from Japan—most of which are considered luxuries in this world. As Mukouda cooks up a storm using his ability, he catches the eye of the fearsome mythical wolf Fenrir. The legendary beast swiftly negotiates a contract to become Mukouda's familiar, unable to resist the delicious dishes. With Fenrir by his side, Mukouda travels the world, earning his keep as an adventurer and merchant all the while enjoying delectable meals.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Tondemo Skill de Isekai Hourou Meshi was released on Blu-ray and DVD in three volumes from April 26, 2023, to June 28, 2023.","season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":569,"type":"anime","name":"MAPPA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":47,"type":"anime","name":"Gourmet","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/47/Gourmet"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Isekai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"}],"demographics":[]}
