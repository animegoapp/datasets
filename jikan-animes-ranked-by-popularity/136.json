Combined with her intimidating gaze, it earns Akane the ominous nickname \"Grim Reaper,\" condemning her to endless bullying for her supposed cursed powers that bring misfortune to everyone around her.\n\nHowever, none of these rumors deter transfer student Taiyou Takada from trying to befriend Akane. As someone who finds the supernatural fascinating, Taiyou approaches the Grim Reaper without hesitation, blissfully unaware of the complicated situation within the class. His bright personality and optimistic worldview may just bring about the change that Akane desperately needs.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Jijou wo Shiranai Tenkousei ga Guigui Kuru. was released on Blu-ray on July 26, 2023.","season":"spring","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"22:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 22:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"},{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Pictures Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/15/Sony_Pictures_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"},{"mal_id":140,"type":"anime","name":"Animax","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/140/Animax"},{"mal_id":323,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Columbia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"},{"mal_id":843,"type":"anime","name":"BS Fuji","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/843/BS_Fuji"},{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"},{"mal_id":1492,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiuri TV Enterprise","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"},{"mal_id":1517,"type":"anime","name":"Jinnan Studio","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1517/Jinnan_Studio"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1998,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Signpost","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1998/Studio_Signpost"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":74,"type":"anime","name":"Romantic Subtext","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/74/Romantic_Subtext"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}
