Kūko wants Nyaruko, but believes both Nyaruko's and Mahiro's \"first time\" belongs to her. Yoriko puts up with all of it and cheerfully runs the house where they all live. Mahiro just wants some sanity. He doesn't want to be the love toy of a Nyarlathotepan, Cthughan, or a shots-like Hasturan. He may or may not hold out.\n\n(Source: ANN)","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2013,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"01:05","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 01:05 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/52/Avex_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":64,"type":"anime","name":"Sotsu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"},{"mal_id":1039,"type":"anime","name":"DIVE II Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1039/DIVE_II_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":372,"type":"anime","name":"NIS America, Inc.","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/372/NIS_America_Inc"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Xebec","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/27/Xebec"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}],"demographics":[]}
