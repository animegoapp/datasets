During one such incident on the first day of his new job, Himuro-kun encounters the beautiful Fuyutsuki-san, who helps him break out of his nerve-induced ice. As it turns out, Fuyutsuki-san is his new coworker.\n\nAt the office, the cool-headed Fuyutsuki-san offers simple and rational solutions to Himuro-kun's icy dilemmas—everything from helping him garden without freezing his plants to ensuring he does not melt during their tropical work retreat. Every time Fuyutsuki-san does something kind for him, the tempest of emotions he experiences inside embarrassingly manifests on the outside.\n\nAs a result of the frequent snowstorms, Himuro-kun's feelings for Fuyutsuki-san are impossible to hide. Even though Fuyutsuki-san is unfamiliar with love, Himuro-kun remains determined to repay her kindness and warm her heart in any way he can.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Koori Zokusei Danshi to Cool na Douryou Joshi was released on Blu-ray in four volumes from April 28, 2023, to July 27, 2023.","season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"22:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 22:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"},{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":1366,"type":"anime","name":"Nagoya Broadcasting Network","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1366/Nagoya_Broadcasting_Network"},{"mal_id":1500,"type":"anime","name":"ABC Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"},{"mal_id":2146,"type":"anime","name":"NetEase","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2146/NetEase"},{"mal_id":2185,"type":"anime","name":"BS Asahi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2185/BS_Asahi"},{"mal_id":2425,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Namco Music Live","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2425/Bandai_Namco_Music_Live"},{"mal_id":2671,"type":"anime","name":"Saber Links","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2671/Saber_Links"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1379,"type":"anime","name":"Zero-G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1379/Zero-G"},{"mal_id":2527,"type":"anime","name":"Liber","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2527/Liber"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"},{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"Workplace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}],"demographics":[]}
