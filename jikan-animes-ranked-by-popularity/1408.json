Taking pity on the unfair life he lived, a god decides to reincarnate Hiraku in another world where he can live as he pleases. Wanting to try farming in this new life, he is bestowed with an all-in-one \"Almighty Farming Tool\" that can transform into any useful implement he wishes. Hiraku is then transported to a forest seemingly far from civilization. Here, he plans to build and farm everything from scratch—gradually developing the lifeless area into a thriving new society.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Isekai Nonbiri Nouka was released on Blu-ray and DVD in two volumes from April 19, 2023, to May 24, 2023.","season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"21:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 21:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":135,"type":"anime","name":"MediaNet","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/135/MediaNet"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":1563,"type":"anime","name":"Hakuhodo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1563/Hakuhodo"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":2671,"type":"anime","name":"Saber Links","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2671/Saber_Links"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1379,"type":"anime","name":"Zero-G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1379/Zero-G"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Isekai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"}],"demographics":[]}
