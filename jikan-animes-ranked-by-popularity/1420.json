After her mother died, her father brought in his lover and her own daughter, Kaya. From then on, Miyo's life was reduced to that of a mere servant. Even worse, while Kaya inherited the family's psychic abilities, Miyo had none—she was truly the daughter with no merit.\n\nAfter years of being treated like dirt, Miyo has learned to keep her head down, hide her pain, and obey every order. So, it comes as no surprise that she is arranged to be married to Kiyoka Kudou, a military captain rumored to be so cruel that he has driven away every one of his potential wives so far.\n\nFrom a painful upbringing to a painful marriage, that's the future that awaits Miyo—or so she thinks. Contrary to her expectations, her new husband is actually kind-hearted. What really awaits Miyo is a blissful, everlasting marriage full of happiness! \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"23:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 23:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"},{"mal_id":1255,"type":"anime","name":"Glovision","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1255/Glovision"},{"mal_id":1390,"type":"anime","name":"Toy's Factory","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1390/Toys_Factory"},{"mal_id":1406,"type":"anime","name":"Miracle Bus","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1406/Miracle_Bus"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":2425,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Namco Music Live","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2425/Bandai_Namco_Music_Live"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":290,"type":"anime","name":"Kinema Citrus","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/290/Kinema_Citrus"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}],"demographics":[]}
