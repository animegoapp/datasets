Though Yuzu has no experience working at such a high-class establishment, Kiri, the affable and reliable head attendant, immediately puts her to work learning the basics.\n\nWhile Yuzu's eagerness initially proves to be more of a hindrance than a blessing, her playful nature brings a unique charm to the inn, as both customers and her fellow workers quickly warm up to her clumsy yet well-meaning mistakes. Under the guidance of the other foxes—the rigid Satsuki, the carefree Natsume, the critical Ren, and the quiet Sakura—Yuzu steadily learns the trade of an inn attendant while learning to love the magical world surrounding her.\n\nKonohana Kitan presents the heartwarming tale of a simple fox girl forging bonds with others and finding a home amidst the mysterious, beautiful world of spirits.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"fall","year":2017,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"20:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 20:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Genco","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"},{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":470,"type":"anime","name":"GAGA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/470/GAGA"},{"mal_id":647,"type":"anime","name":"Memory-Tech","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/647/Memory-Tech"},{"mal_id":719,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Mausu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"},{"mal_id":1576,"type":"anime","name":"DeNA","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1576/DeNA"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":1821,"type":"anime","name":"Melonbooks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1821/Melonbooks"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":456,"type":"anime","name":"Lerche","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/456/Lerche"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":26,"type":"anime","name":"Girls Love","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/26/Girls_Love"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":51,"type":"anime","name":"Anthropomorphic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"},{"mal_id":52,"type":"anime","name":"CGDCT","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/52/CGDCT"},{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"},{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"},{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"Workplace","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}
