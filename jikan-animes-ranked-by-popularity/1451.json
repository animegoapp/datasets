Despite her groom Elias Ainsworth's reluctance, Chise accepts the proposal, as she believes attending the school might help her minimize her self-sacrificing tendencies.\n\nFrom the get-go, Chise grabs the attention of her classmates and professors alike, who have never seen a mage in action before. However, there is a sinister plot brewing behind the College's back, and the young mage will have to determine who is friend or foe in order to put a stop to it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"22:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 22:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":464,"type":"anime","name":"flying DOG","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/464/flying_DOG"},{"mal_id":1294,"type":"anime","name":"Sound Team Don Juan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1294/Sound_Team_Don_Juan"},{"mal_id":1414,"type":"anime","name":"bilibili","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1414/bilibili"},{"mal_id":1452,"type":"anime","name":"Mag Garden","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1452/Mag_Garden"},{"mal_id":1639,"type":"anime","name":"Chiptune","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1639/Chiptune"},{"mal_id":1747,"type":"anime","name":"Twin Engine","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1747/Twin_Engine"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":2205,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Kafka","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2205/Studio_Kafka"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Mythology","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}
