The uneasy truce soon collapses as Masters demonstrate that they will do anything in their power, no matter how despicable, to win.\n\nSeeds of doubt are sown between Kiritsugu Emiya and Saber, his Servant, as their conflicting ideologies on heroism and chivalry clash. Meanwhile, an ominous bond forms between Kirei Kotomine, who still seeks to find his purpose in life, and one of the remaining Servants. As the countdown to the end of the war reaches zero, the cost of winning begins to blur the line between victory and defeat.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2012,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"00:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":459,"type":"anime","name":"Nitroplus","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/459/Nitroplus"},{"mal_id":701,"type":"anime","name":"Seikaisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/701/Seikaisha"},{"mal_id":703,"type":"anime","name":"Notes","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/703/Notes"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":43,"type":"anime","name":"ufotable","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/43/ufotable"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]}
