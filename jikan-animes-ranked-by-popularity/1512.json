When he complains, his boss fires him, claiming that he is easily replaceable. As if his luck was not bad enough, a truck suddenly hits and kills Saitou on his way home.\n\nSurprisingly enough, Saitou does not die; instead, he is transported to another world. There, he meets a party composed of the female knight Raelza, the moonlight fairy Lafanpan, and the mage Morlock, who are all coincidentally looking to recruit a new member with a skill set like Saitou's.\n\nThroughout their time together, Saitou uses his expertise to assist his fellow party members and soon comes to receive the recognition he never thought was possible. However, Saitou's presence may just be the catalyst that will connect a diverse cast of people from different places, slowly uncovering the fate that could bring a great change to this world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Benriya Saitou-san, Isekai ni Iku was released on Blu-ray and DVD in three volumes from March 24, 2023, to May 24, 2023.","season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"22:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 22:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":238,"type":"anime","name":"AT-X","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"},{"mal_id":1680,"type":"anime","name":"BS NTV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1680/BS_NTV"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":2289,"type":"anime","name":"GREE Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2289/GREE_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":605,"type":"anime","name":"C2C","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/605/C2C"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Isekai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"}],"demographics":[]}
