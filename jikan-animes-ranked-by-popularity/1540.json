Cid Kageno and Shadow Garden investigate the Lawless City, a cesspool where the red moon hangs low in the sky and three powerful monarchs rule the streets. The true draw for Cid, however, is one who can draw blood–the Blood Queen, a vampire who has slumbered in her coffin for eons. Her awakening approaches, and Cid could finally face a day of reckoning.\n\n(Source: HIDIVE)\n\nEpisode 1 was previewed at a screening at Anime Expo on July 1, 2023.
