With every passing day, the lives of these six, as well as of the many people around them, experience both the calms of normal life and the insanity of the absurd. Walking to school, being bitten by a talking crow, spending time with friends, and watching the principal suplex a deer: they are all in a day's work in the extraordinary everyday lives of those in Nichijou. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Bandai Entertainment had licensed Nichijou, but on January 2, 2012, it was announced they were leaving the North American anime market with all unreleased titles including Nichijou being cancelled. The series would remain unlicensed until November 4, 2016 when Funimation Entertainment acquired the series, and released it sub-only in a complete Blu-ray & DVD combo pack on February 7, 2017. They also did a Blu-ray & Digital combo pack with a brand new English dub, which was released on July 23, 2019.","season":"spring","year":2011,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"02:20","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 02:20 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":104,"type":"anime","name":"Lantis","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"},{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":211,"type":"anime","name":"Rakuonsha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/211/Rakuonsha"},{"mal_id":352,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Pictures Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/352/Kadokawa_Pictures_Japan"},{"mal_id":460,"type":"anime","name":"KlockWorx","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"},{"mal_id":929,"type":"anime","name":"Animation Do","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/929/Animation_Do"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"},{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Kyoto Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2/Kyoto_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":57,"type":"anime","name":"Gag Humor","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/57/Gag_Humor"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}
