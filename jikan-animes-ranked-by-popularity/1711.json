To compensate for this handicap, the young ninja tenaciously endures severe training to hone his hand-to-hand combat skills. Whenever necessary, he also resorts to creative fighting techniques. With the constant support of his teammates Neji Hyuuga and Tenten, Lee readily embraces daring adventures as opportunities to advance on his path toward excellence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Naruto SD: Rock Lee no Seishun Full-Power Ninden is a Naruto: Shippuuden non-canon spin-off. Unlike the original series, it is the work of a different author and presents distinctive elements: another main character, a super-deformed art style, a narrator, and topics or statements that can be difficult to understand even for adults. The first DVD was released on July 18, 2012. Starting October 1, 2013, the anime was re-broadcasted as a selection of episodes from the initial series under the title Naruto SD: Rock Lee no Seishun Full-Power Ninden Mou Iccho. It is also considered that Rock Lee Ocharake Gaiden—a separate feature shown in five installments as a bonus of Naruto Shippuuden—is essentially Naruto SD: Rock Lee no Seishun Full Power Ninden's predecessor. As of March 2015, both dubbed and subtitled English versions have been made available for online streaming in the United States through Hulu and Neon Alley.","season":"spring","year":2012,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"18:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 18:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Pierrot","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Pierrot"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":20,"type":"anime","name":"Parody","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}
