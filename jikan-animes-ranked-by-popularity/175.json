But their monstrous target already has a devious plan in store for them and the two hundred passengers: by delving deep into their consciousness, the demon intends to obliterate everyone in a stunning display of the power held by the Twelve Kizuki. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Mugen Ressha-hen adapts chapters 54 to 66 of the manga.
