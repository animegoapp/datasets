However, this peace is short-lived; a sleeping evil awakens in the dark reaches of the galaxy: Beerus, the ruthless God of Destruction.\n\nDisturbed by a prophecy that he will be defeated by a \"Super Saiyan God,\" Beerus and his angelic attendant Whis start searching the universe for this mysterious being. Before long, they reach Earth where they encounter Gokuu Son, one of the planet's mightiest warriors, and his similarly powerful friends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Dragon Ball Super's first 27 episodes are adaptations of the films Dragon Ball Z Movie 14: Kami to Kami (episodes 1-14) and Dragon Ball Z Movie 15: Fukkatsu no F (episodes 15-27).","season":"summer","year":2015,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"09:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 09:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":127,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiko Advertising","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/127/Yomiko_Advertising"},{"mal_id":169,"type":"anime","name":"Fuji TV","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}
