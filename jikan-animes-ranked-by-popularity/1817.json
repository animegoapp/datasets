But despite the colorful cast, the one character Kobayashi is most obsessed with is the villainess Lieselotte Riefenstahl. Contrary to her rude remarks toward Fiene, Lieselotte longs to be her friend. Lieselotte is also deeply in love with her own fiancé, Prince Siegwald Fitzenhagen—the game's main love interest. Unfortunately, in almost every route, Lieselotte is doomed to a tragic end.\n\nKobayashi manages to convince Endou to play MagiKoi to practice his speaking skills. What begins as a normal playthrough turns extraordinary when Siegwald suddenly hears the players' voices inside the game! Now labeled as \"gods,\" Endou and Kobayashi use their comments and analyses to save their beloved tsundere villainess from her fated demise.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:55","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:55 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"},{"mal_id":1542,"type":"anime","name":"DMM.com","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1542/DMMcom"},{"mal_id":1585,"type":"anime","name":"Nichion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1585/Nichion"},{"mal_id":1590,"type":"anime","name":"FuRyu","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1590/FuRyu"},{"mal_id":1671,"type":"anime","name":"DMM pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1671/DMM_pictures"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"},{"mal_id":2074,"type":"anime","name":"Bit grooove promotion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2074/Bit_grooove_promotion"},{"mal_id":2111,"type":"anime","name":"Pia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2111/Pia"},{"mal_id":2146,"type":"anime","name":"NetEase","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2146/NetEase"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":200,"type":"anime","name":"Tezuka Productions","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/200/Tezuka_Productions"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Video Game","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/79/Video_Game"}],"demographics":[]}
