But although he was easily the best in his old town, Nankatsu has a lot more competition, and he will need all of his skill and talent in order to stand out from this new crowd.\n\nHe encounters not only rivals, but also new friends like the pretty girl Sanae Nakazawa and the talented goalkeeper, Genzo Wakabayashi, who shares the same passion as Tsubasa, and will prove to be a treasured friend in helping him push towards his dreams. Representing Japan in the FIFA World Cup is Tsubasa’s ultimate dream, but it will take a lot more than talent to reach it.","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2018,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"01:35","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 01:35 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":415,"type":"anime","name":"Warner Bros.
