Since then, he has had a hard time showing others his true feelings in fear of being rejected again. However, as luck would have it, Junichi may have a second chance at love when he meets several girls whom he becomes romantically interested in: Haruka Morishima, the energetic and popular upperclassman with a love for cute things; Kaoru Tanamachi, his childhood friend who harbors secret feelings for him; Sae Nakata, the timid transfer student who is shy around men; Ai Nanasaki, a girl on the swim team who has a bad first impression of Junichi; Rihoko Sakurai, a childhood friend with a love for sweets; and Tsukasa Ayatsuji, a seemingly perfect class representative who has a hidden dark side. As Christmas Eve approaches, Junichi can only hope that this will be the year he will finally spend the holidays with the one he truly loves.\n \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"summer","year":2010,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":145,"type":"anime","name":"TBS","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"},{"mal_id":166,"type":"anime","name":"Movic","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"AIC","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":35,"type":"anime","name":"Harem","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]}
