Amid this turmoil, an isolated facility shelters children and nurtures them in peace. However, as a few among them find out about the world beyond the narrow periphery of their nursery's walls, their curiosity about it slowly grows.\n\nMeanwhile, in the outside world, young survivors Maru and Kiruko band together to search for a special place called Heaven, each for their own reasons. Carrying past burdens and tragic secrets, the two hope to find answers to the cruelty they have experienced in their lives and in the world, which still remains in tatters.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Tengoku Daimakyou was released on Blu-ray in two volumes from August 30, 2023, to September 27, 2023.","season":"spring","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"22:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 22:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":143,"type":"anime","name":"Mainichi Broadcasting System","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"},{"mal_id":1113,"type":"anime","name":"NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1113/NBCUniversal_Entertainment_Japan"},{"mal_id":1284,"type":"anime","name":"Avex Pictures","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"},{"mal_id":2146,"type":"anime","name":"NetEase","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2146/NetEase"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":76,"type":"anime","name":"Survival","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/76/Survival"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}
