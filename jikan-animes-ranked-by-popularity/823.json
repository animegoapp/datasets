Tasked with infiltrating the kingdom of Grace—a mission that could change the fate of the world—Roku-gou mistakenly believes that his skills as a combatant are superb, fuelling his arrogant attitude. To ensure the success of the mission, Alice Kisaragi, an exceptional android with a youthful appearance named after the company itself, is assigned to be Roku-gou's travel companion. \n\nUpon their arrival at the outskirts of the kingdom, Alice and Roku-gou encounter Snow, the commander of the country's royal guard. Snow leads the pair to a broken legendary artifact, and Roku-gou seizes the opportunity for a long-awaited promotion at his company and changes the recitation for the sacred ritual to an embarrassing phrase. As punishment, the princess of the kingdom forces Roku-gou to become an honorary knight, fulfilling part of his mission. Having infiltrated the kingdom's inner circle, Roku-gou must now help his new employer fight against the Demon Lord's Army, all while perpetuating evil deeds as a combatant of the Kisaragi Corporation. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Sundays","time":"21:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Sundays at 21:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":323,"type":"anime","name":"Nippon Columbia","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"},{"mal_id":1696,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"J.C.Staff","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":62,"type":"anime","name":"Isekai","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"}],"demographics":[]}
