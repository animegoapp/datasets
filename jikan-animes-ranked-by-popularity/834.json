Failing to have any friends, he blames the convoluted mechanics and unfair rules of life, forcing him to give up and proclaim himself a bottom-tier character in this \"game.\"\n\nAfter a fateful meeting with another top-tier Tackfam player, Fumiya is shocked to discover the player's true identity—Aoi Hinami, a popular, smart, and sociable classmate who is the complete opposite of himself. Aoi, surprised at how inept Fumiya is at everything besides Tackfam, decides to assist him in succeeding in what she calls the greatest game of them all. Through the gruesome ordeals of social interactions and relationships, Fumiya begins to advance tiers in the glorious game of life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2021,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"21:00","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 21:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":1883,"type":"anime","name":"APDREAM","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1883/APDREAM"},{"mal_id":2074,"type":"anime","name":"Bit grooove promotion","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2074/Bit_grooove_promotion"},{"mal_id":2090,"type":"anime","name":"Dream Shift","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2090/Dream_Shift"},{"mal_id":2441,"type":"anime","name":"Bergamo","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2441/Bergamo"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":439,"type":"anime","name":"Project No.9","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/439/Project_No9"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]}
