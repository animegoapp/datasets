Anyone would think that these two are best friends for life. The only issue is that the tomboyish Tomo is in love with Jun, but he regards her like a brother.\n\nAt the start of their first year of high school, Tomo confesses her feelings to Jun. However, her rough mannerisms and lack of hesitance to throw a punch do nothing to sway Jun's heart. Realizing that he will remain indifferent to her affections unless she does something about it, Tomo must find a way to knock some sense into Jun and open his eyes to what is right in front of him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2023,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":701,"type":"anime","name":"Seikaisha","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/701/Seikaisha"},{"mal_id":1468,"type":"anime","name":"Crunchyroll","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"},{"mal_id":2640,"type":"anime","name":"INSPION Edge","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2640/INSPION_Edge"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1087,"type":"anime","name":"Lay-duce","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1087/Lay-duce"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}],"demographics":[]}
