However, the universe where Eve knows no defeat is shaken after she plays a clean game with Aoi Amawashi, a golfing prodigy that came to the country of Nafrece to enter a golf tournament. Armed with talent and born into the perfect environment for golf, Aoi the \"Innocent Tyrant\" calmly crushes her enemies with a bright smile on her face.\n\nAfter their game-changing match, Eve and Aoi become intrigued with each other and promise to battle again someday.
